## 1.0. Introduction
The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) was created in 1971. This agency is responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's Medallion (Yellow) taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles (community-based liveries, black cars and luxury limousines), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles opereate in the city. It is approximated that about one million trips are recorded each day. There are Four types of trips broken down into Yellow Taxi, Green Taxi, For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) and High Volume For-Hire Vehicle (FHVHV). TLC receives taxi trip data from the technology service providers (TSPs) that provide electronic metering in each cab, and FHV trip data from the app, community livery, black car, or luxury limousine company, or base, who dispatched the trip.

## 2.0. Project Objective
This project was aimed at using the tools and knowledge acquired in the course to do data wrangling and analysis of a sampled subset of data from the TLC database. This objective was broken down into the following tasks:<br>
> - **2.1. Collecting metadata, inspecting schema evolution:** Understanding the data and its characteristics
> - **2.2. Data integration:** Updating old schemas to the latest schema for each subdatset
> - **2.3. Data cleaning:** Checking files for record errors, repairing them and separting into good and bad records.
> - **2.4. Analysis:** Answering queries and plotting results using matplotlib

<br>See the assignment file for more details about the above objectives. 
## 3.0. Methodology
### 3.1. About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project was generated by uniformly sampling 0.2\% without repetition from each file per taxi trip types. The sampled dataset consist of records from 2009 with just the Yellow taxi uptil 2020 with all four taxi records included. The four sub-datasets representing the four trip types do not provide the same information. More information is provided by the data dictionaries found on the [TLC Trip Record Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
