# INFO-H-600-507332
Data Science is all about analyzing data. Before data is suitable for analysis, however, it often needs to be wrangled, which means that it needs to transformed into a shape that is suitable for analysis. In particular, data often needs to be integrated, cleaned, and transformed, before any analysis can be made. The goal in this project is to use the tools introduced in INFOH600 (namely: Python, its data science libraries, and big data tools) to do a conceptually relatively simple analysis of a real-world dataset. Data wrangling is an essential part of the project.
